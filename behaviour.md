Avoid vibe-coded website patterns:

COLORS & VISUAL

- No default purple gradients unless brand-appropriate
- Remove sparkles, emojis from hero headings
- Eliminate generic glowing hover effects

TYPOGRAPHY

- Consistent weight hierarchy (avoid oversized headings + ultra-thin body)
- Uniform line-height and paragraph spacing
- Define type scale, stick to it

LAYOUT & COMPONENTS

- Identical component placement across pages
- Consistent border radius values (define 2-3 max)
- Subtle hover states (2-4px lift max)
- Proportional icon sizing relative to text
- Remove non-functional social icons

ANIMATIONS & INTERACTIONS

- Add easing curves (cubic-bezier)
- Stagger timing intentionally
- Every animation serves purpose

UX BEHAVIORS

- Loading states for all async actions
- Progress indicators on buttons
- Functional toggles/carousels/interactions
- Skeleton screens for data-heavy sections

COPYWRITING

- Remove em-dash overuse
- Avoid vague phrases: "Launch faster", "Build your dreams", "Create without limits"
- No fake testimonials
- No generic AI faces or "Sarah Chen" placeholder names

CORE PRINCIPLE

Create a design system first. Every spacing value, color, radius, weight, and animation should reference that system. Inconsistency signals vibe-coding more than any single element.
